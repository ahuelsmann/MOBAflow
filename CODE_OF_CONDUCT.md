## Our Pledge
We aim to provide a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of background or experience level.

## Our Standards

- Provide helpful feedback and assume good intent.
- Focus on the issue, not the person.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Publishing others' private information without permission.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, chat, events) and when representing the project publicly.

## Enforcement
- Report concerns privately via Azure DevOps work item (Security/Code of Conduct) assigned to the maintainer (@ahuelsmann).

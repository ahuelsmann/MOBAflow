Your Contributions to the open-source portion of the Project will be licensed under MIT. The Maintainer reserves the right to develop proprietary extensions that build upon the open-source foundation, but this does not affect the MIT license of the core project or your contributions.

**Clarification**: The MIT-licensed codebase, including all community contributions, will never be relicensed under a proprietary-only license. Commercial offerings will be separate products or optional add-ons.
